CompleteParser
==============

A parser which will recognize a context-free grammar from a text file, accept input from the user, and produce output matching the grammar.

This is a Visual Studio 2012 project which has gone through several iterations starting as a class assignment. It is currently set to compile as a DLL.

The program works by loading grammar:
TERMINAL -> Non-Terminal

Calculating first and follow sets and loading the rules into memory.
Accepting user input.
Psuedo compiles to a linked list for program execution.
